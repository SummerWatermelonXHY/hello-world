First Practice

Hey bros!This my first time being here and having a GitHub account.Long age(3 or 4 years earlier) I've heard about GitHub, but I didn't have the motivation to creat an account in this amazing website because at that time I don't really need coding. Now I come here because now I'm in my postgraduate learning programme and I have participated in a competition about modelling, which means I'd better have a good command of machine learing,feature engineering and coding.
Hope I can learn and pratice a lot in this amazing website!
